# TYPE can be FOLDER, SOCKET, RANDOM, or CHECKFOLD
# NAME is the name of bot and determines which persistent datastore the bot
#      accesses. For example, if you want to test a bot that learns over time
#      keep the same name so it can access the data it stored in previous
#      matches.
# RESET_KEYS determines whether the key/value store is cleared when starting
#      up. It's false by default.

# FOLDER: Automatically compiles and runs a bot from source.
# Requires PATH, which is either an absolute or relative (to the jar) path
# pointing to the source code.
